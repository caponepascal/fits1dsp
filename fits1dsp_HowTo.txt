Plotting GUI for 1D spectra from FITS files.
The script uses a .json catalog file ("extensions_catalog.json") to store and access the location of the data depending on the observation instrument. The GUI is implemented using PyQt5 via .ui files ("fits1dsp_main.ui", "fits1dsp_infotab.ui", "fits1dsp_plottab.ui" and "fits1dsp_help.ui").

Functionalities and Buttons:
_ Command line:
    - -f, --files: FITS files to be selected on start; must be given as individual paths to the FITS files or to files containing a list of paths to the individual FITS files
- General: 
    - "quit": close the program
    - "help": open new window containing the information provided in fits1dsp_HowTo.txt
- File selection:
    FITS:
    - "browse": add FITS files to the selection table
    - "select all": select all FITS files in the selection table
    - "unselect all": unselect all FITS files in the selection table
    - "remove": remove the selected files from the selection table
    - "clear": remove all files from the selection table
    Mask:
    - "browse": add .dat files to the selection table
    - "remove": remove the selected files from the selection table
    - "clear": remove all files from the selection table
Files can be selected by checking the respective row in the table. Only one telluric mask can be selected at a time. Removing a FITS file from the selection table will automatically close the corresponding info and plot tabs.
- Info:
    - "info": show the file structure and headers of the selected files in separate tabs
- Plot:
    - "Channel": select the data channel to plot
    - "Wavelength units": select the wavelength units for the plot
    - "Normalize": compute a 3rd order polynomial continuum fit for normalization; intended to be qualitative to facilitate plotting data from different instruments
    - "plot separate": plot the data from the selected FITS files separately in different tabs
    - "plot together": plot the data from the selected FITS files together in the same tab
    - "update": not available yet

Notes:
Currently only works with HPF and CARMENES data.
